# FuSD
Functional Signed Directionality (FuSD) is a distribution-free, nonparametric framework for quantile-based inference in function spaces. This repository provides code to compute FuSD, set-valued functional quantiles, quantile-based spread and skewness summaries, and tight probability bands, with reproducible environmental case studies.
