# FuSD
Functional Signed Directionality (FuSD) is a distribution-free, nonparametric framework for quantile-based inference in function spaces. This repository provides code to compute FuSD, set-valued functional quantiles, quantile-based spread and skewness summaries, and tight probability bands, with reproducible environmental case studies. For reproducibility, we include processed functional datasets for the Monterrey metropolitan area (Nuevo León, Mexico), including Landsat 8 Land Surface Temperature (LST) and NDVI curves from 2018 to 2024, and scripts to reproduce the empirical illustrations reported in the paper and Supplementary Material.
